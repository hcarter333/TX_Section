The theory of hole superconductivity modifies BCS theory to propose that the paired charge carriers are “undressed” holes instead of electrons.  As a consequence of this modification, the theory further states that electrons are expelled from the interior of the superconductor and exist as an excess charge density contained within the London penetration depth at the surface of the material.  The theory predicts several experimentally testable consequences.  Of these, arguably the most interesting, and the most easily tested prediction is the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation by the expelled electrons as they redistribute in the superconductor when the superconducting state is quenched.  The maximum energy of the Bremsstrahlung spectrum predicted by the theory is 308.22 keV using a superconducting sample of lead with a radius of 3.8 cm.  The theory predicts a solid angle maximum flux of 182,000 events.  Progress on the experimental search for the predicted ionizing radiation will be presented.
