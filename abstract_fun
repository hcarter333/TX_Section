Do superconductors emit x-rays when they quench?  Do holes lead double lives, undressing and pairing up as electrons when it gets cold?  Can the London penetration depth be explained by holes reducing their kinetic energy and getting... well... fat?  An experimental search is underway for the x-ray radiation predicted by Hirsch's hole theory of superconductivity.  Hirsch coined the phrase "spin Hall effect" in his 1999 PRL article, and invented the h-index.  Will h-rays from superconductors be his next big achievement?  You'll learn about the BCS theory of superconductivity and how hole superconductivity meshes with it. Then you'll find out how we intend to quench superconductors and detect, or not, the consequent h-rays.  You'll come away feeling more comfortable with BCS, harmonic oscillators, and coherent states.  You'll learn about pulsed magnetic fields and x-ray detection techniques.  You'll be the envy of your friends at parties as you describe both superconductor theory and cutting edge experiments on the frontier of modern physics with confidence and aplomb.
