The theory of hole superconductivity proposes that the BCS Cooper Pairs are composed of undressed holes as opposed to electrons.  There are several consequences to this seemingly inoquous choice.  First, superconductivtity is due to kinetic energy lowering rather than potential energy lowering.  Seocnd, the Cooper pairs composed of holes occupy an orbital whose radius is equal to the London penetration depth.  These orbitls, several 1000 times wider than their electron based counternparts imply an excess negative charge density on the surface of the sample as well as paired macroscopic counter-rotating spin currents.  Finally, it is these high velocity spin currents that the theory of hole superconductivity predicts will emit x-ray radiation when the superconducting state is quenched.  An experimental search for this x-ray radiation has been mounted.
